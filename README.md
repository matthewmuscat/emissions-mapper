# Emissions Mapper

A mapper that visualises emitted pollution on a global scale. This project utilises a React-based front-end, alongside the back-end utilising a RESTful API hosted on a Serverless Instance. This project was collaboratively developed - including Lachlan Young, Angus Philippini, Brian Riwu Kaho, and myself as part of a weekend Hackathon.
